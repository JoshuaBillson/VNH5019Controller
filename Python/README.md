# VNH5019Controller Python Library
This library provides the Controller class to generate valid messages and communicate with the 
motor controller via either I2C or USB. Before any commands can be sent, the functions **init_serial()**
or **init_i2c()** must be called. The constants **CHANNEL_1**, **CHANNEL_2**, and **BOTH** are passed to
**Controller.write_speed()** and **Controller.write_brake()** to select the appropriate channel.

## Classes:
**Controller**  
A class for writing to the VNH5019 Motor Controller via either I2C or USB.

## Constants:
**CHANNEL_1**  
**CHANNEL_2**  
**BOTH**  

## Functions:
**init_serial(port_name)**  
Initialize a serial port for communication with the motor controller.  
port_name (string): The name of the serial port to communicate over.  

**init_i2c(pre_existing_bus=None)**  
Initialize the serial bus for communication.  
pre_existing_bus (SMBus): A pre-existing I2C bus if it exists.  

**Controller.write_speed(channel, value)**  
Write a speed value between -100 (full reverse) to 100 (full forward) to one or both channels.  
channel (int): The channel whose speed we want to set. Must be one of CHANNEL_1, CHANNEL_2, or BOTH.  
value (int): The speed we want to set between -100 to 100.  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.  

 **Controller.write_brake(channel, value)**
Write a brake value between 0 (coast) to 100 (max brake) to one or both channels.  
channel (int): The channel whose speed we want to set. Must be one of CHANNEL_1, CHANNEL_2, or BOTH.  
value (int): The brake we want to set between 0 to 100.  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.  

**Controller.write_mixed_command(speed_val, turn_val)**
Write a mixed command to the motor controller.  
speed_val (int): The speed we want to write between -100 (full reverse) to 100 (full forward).  
turn_val (int): The turn value we want to write between -100 (max left) to 100 (max right).  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.  

**Controller.stop()**
Stop both motors by applying max brakes.  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.  

**Controller.set_active()**
Put the motor controller into an active state.  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.  

**Controller.set_standby()**
Put the motor controller into standby.  
Returns (bytes): The bytes to be written to the controller.
